<div class="text">
<p>The consequences of pollution and climate change leave no communities untouched, but they burden communities of color at disproportionate rates, down to the very air they breathe. </p>
<p>Across the nation, particulate matter from pollution-emitting facilities burdens Black people over one and a half times the rate that it does White people, scientists reported in the American Journal of Public Health. Race, even more than poverty level, was more influential in particulate matter exposure. 
<p>Air quality measures from Washington D.C. and the surrounding Maryland area showed that in 2019, 154 days had moderate or worse air quality due to pollutants. Inhaling this particulate matter can lead to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and cancers. The systemic exposure to pollutants leaves Black communities particularly at risk for adverse health outcomes of pollution.</p>
<p>Though The World Resources Institute reported that Maryland’s emissions decreased at a greater rate than any other state in recent years, advocates for environmental justice argue that the state can do more to protect the populations who have been systematically oppressed, and must push for stricter pollution regulations to combat dangerous health effects.</p>

<h3 class="subhead">What is Environmental Racism?</h3>

<p>Dr. Robert Bullard pioneered research of American environmental racism in the 1970s when he found that every city-owned landfill was in a predominantly Black neighborhood, and six of eight incinerators were too. When he expanded his research throughout the South, he found that the same pattern of Black people bearing the cost of waste and pollution repeated throughout states and countries.</p> 
<p>Environmental Reporter and University of Maryland Adjunct Professor Rona Kobell explained that environmental racism, like all forms of racism, has to do with an unequal share of power.</p> 
<p>“The areas where Black, and Hispanic, and lower income residents tend to live are also the areas where industry tends to dump its crap. That’s where they put smokestacks. That’s where they put dumps,” Kobell said. “It’s a lot of decisions to put things that people in nice neighborhoods don’t want in the not-as-nice neighborhoods because you know the people don’t have the political clout to object to it. It’s an unequal distribution of the pain of being an industrial society forced upon the poorest among us.”</p>
<p>University of Maryland Associate Professor Dr. Sacoby Wilson experienced the effects of environmental injustice growing up in Vicksburg, Mississippi next to a landfill, a sewage treatment plant, and a major highway.</p>
<p>At Maryland, he directs the Community Engagement, Environmental Justice, and Health program.</p> 
<p>His defines environmental justice as a “three-legged stool.”</p>
<p>Disadvantaged communities suffer from an overburden of hazards like incinerators, landfills, and roadways. They also have a “high concentration of psychosocial stressors,” he said. The third leg of the stool is a lack of health-promoting infrastructure like markets and green spaces.</p>

    <p>Researchers with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found that nationally, Black people are subject to inhaling 1.54 times the amount of air pollution particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller than the entire population. Particulate matter burdens people in poverty at 1.35 times the rate and all non-Whites at 1.28 times the rate.</p>

    <p>This fine particulate matter is formed in the atmosphere as a result of pollutants emitted from power plants, industries and automobiles, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Larger polluting particles might be emitted directly from a source such as a construction site or fires. Landfills emit both fine particulate matter and larger particulate matter through transporting waste, mechanical recycling and composting, and other activities according to a study in Waste Management.</p> 
    <p>The power plants and the landfill in Prince George’s County are concentrated towards the south, where the zip codes are home to a higher percentage of Black Marylanders than the northern part of the county, according to 2013-2017 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates. The population density is also lower in the south, making the area more logical for large facilities like power plants.</p>

<p>University of Maryland Associate Professor of Environmental Toxicology Dr. Lance Yankos explained that pollution emitting facilities in Prince George’s County may not have intentionally burdened Black communities, but the repercussions exist regardless.</p>
<p>“It isn’t as simple as saying, ‘They would only let Black people live here and they would only let White people live here,’ but the economics and the consequence is very real,” Yonkos said. “It isn’t necessarily done as intentionally reducing risk to White people and increasing risk to Black people, it’s just the evolution of the economics of these situations.”</p>
<p>In 2019, 154 days had moderate or worse air quality in D.C. and the surrounding Maryland area including Prince George’s County, according to an analysis of the Maryland Ambient Air Monitoring Program. The Maryland Department of the Environment calculated the Air Quality Index under EPA guidelines. The air quality reflects the levels of the two major pollutants in Maryland: ground-level ozone and fine particles and their associate health effects.</p>

<p>Operators of the Chalk Point Generating Station, by far the leading polluting station in Prince George’s County according to a pollution research site called Scorecard.org, scheduled to close the stations two coal-fired units in June 2021.</p> 
<p>Since 1964, the station has polluted the air above the south-easternmost point of Prince George’s County. Two small towns neighbor the station, Aquasco and Eagle Harbor, are historically Black communities dating back to the 17th century according to the Maryland-National Capital Planning and Park Commission.</p>
<p>While the coal-fired Chalk Point Generating Station is closing, more natural gas-fueled power stations are slated to open in Brandywine, Prince George’s County. The Panda Mattawoman Power Project received its air permit 2015, but according to its website, its operation date remains to be determined.</p>

<p>The Mattawoman Plant’s construction location is just over a mile from the PSEG Keys Energy Center, another natural gas-fueled station that began operating in 2018. The plants’ proponents promise to that they will power over 1.5 million homes in Prince George’s County and the surrounding area and bring millions in tax revenue.</p> 
<p>They also emit nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and particulate matter in the air, which is especially dangerous to neighboring Brandywine. The town is home to 6,700 residents, 72% of whom are Black.</p>
<p>Wilson suggests that Brandywine’s lack of political power led them to the position of being what he calls, “the dumping ground of Prince George’s County.”</p>
<p>“Brandywine is an unincorporated community, so they don’t have a town mayor and town council. Areas that are unincorporated have very little political representation,” he said. “They may have a county representative, but the county representative represents the interest of the county. So, they end up being targeted for local unwanted land uses, so I call it, ‘Contamination without representation.’”</p>
<p>Wilson pushed back on the idea that the benefits of the power stations—energy and money-- outweigh the environmental and health hazards, because they don’t benefit the community who suffers the most at their expense. He referred to this issue as “environmental slavery.”</p>
<p>“Environmental slavery is really about differential burden and differential benefits. Someone else is using you to host these land uses, and you get no economic, social, health, environmental benefit from it. All you get are the externalities,” he said. “Your ecosystems are basically being used as a sink for pollution that come up right. Then literally, your body is also used as a sink for pollution. The way we permit facilities in this country is a form of state sanctioned violence.”</p>


<h3 class="subhead">Why fine particulate matter is so dangerous to health</h3>
<p>Particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers forms as a result of reactions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These chemicals are released from power plants, industries and automobiles.</p>
<p>Fine particulate matter is invasive to the human body.</p>
<p>“Imagine the inside of a wet balloon. If you were to put a tiny little bit of powder in there, it’s never coming out. It’s now going to stick to the sides. There’s no mechanism to effectively cause that to leave,” Yonkos said.</p>
<p>The effects of inhaling fine particulate matter range from respiratory irritation to cancer.</p>
<p>“The chemically benign ones cause irritation which can cause pneumonia, but most are not chemically benign,” Yonkos said. “They are carcinogenic and are absorbed through cell membranes into the bloodstream, which can lead to tumors and cancer.”</p>

    <p>White people disproportionately die from lower chronic respiratory disease in Maryland, which complicates the study of air pollution effects. Yonkos said that this may be a result that more often, heart disease and cancers are more life threatening than chronic lower respiratory diseases. Yonkos also pointed to the fact that a large amount of the people in their upper years spent much of their lives smoking cigarettes.</p>

<p>“There could be something really bad about this, and probably is,” Yonkos said. “What you may have died of in the 1960s, you may live with now for another 6 or 8 years or longer, because of the availability of medications that put off the onset of stroke and other things. We know the application of treatment options is extremely disproportionate. It could be that what finally can't be treated is the dramatic reduction in your respiratory tract, but all the other ailments have been treated with medication,” he said.</p>
 
<h3 class="subhead">How to combat environmental injustice</h3>
<p>Kobell said that the government needs to put more pressure on the business sector to reduce emissions in order to promote environmental justice. </p>
<p>“We’re too quick as a country to allow companies to self-regulate, and obviously, they're going to do what costs the least amount of money,” she said. “I think we need enforcement, fines, more inspectors and to make it shameful to treat the planet the way polluters have. Communities can only absorb so much, and it’s time to protect places instead of just dumping more stuff on them.”</p>
<p>Maryland established the Commission on Climate Change in 2015, and much of their Annual Report for 2020 aimed at combating environmental injustice. In September, the Commission appointed a co-chair to focus on environmental justice, Charmaine Brown.
<p>The Commission recommended that Maryland adopt more ambitious greenhouse reduction goals-- to 50 percent reduction from 2006 levels by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2045. </p>
<p>The Report passed unanimously within the Maryland Department of energy, though the Maryland Energy Administration abstained from voting.</p>
<p>Climate Change Program Communications Manager Susan E. Casey is excited by these goals and the future of environmental justice work in Maryland.</p>
<p>“This is a huge success. In the past, people have voted no, there have been minority reports. This is the first time that environmental groups who you might say are on the left, and business groups who are on the right have actually found common ground to unanimously adopt this.”</p>
<p>Wilson said that biggest driver for change in the fight for environmental justice is individual empathy.</p>
<p>“What’s missing in this discussion about environmental justice and injustice is our shared humanity. We need to be able to recognize the pain that folks are going through and have the compassion to say, ‘You know what, that's not right. I should do something about that. I should be part of the solution,’” Wilson said.</p>
